🧠 MNIST Digit Recognizer – End-to-End Deployment with FastAPI & Docker

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning deployment pipeline — from training a CNN on the MNIST dataset to serving predictions through a FastAPI backend, a custom web UI, and Dockerized deployment.

The project focuses on reproducibility, portability, and real-world ML engineering practices.

🚀 Project Highlights

Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition

Built a FastAPI-based REST API for model inference

Designed a custom HTML UI for user-friendly digit prediction

Dockerized the entire system for consistent execution across environments

Enabled both developer testing (Swagger) and end-user interaction (UI)

🧩 Tech Stack

Python 3.10

PyTorch – CNN training and inference

FastAPI – backend API

Uvicorn – ASGI server

Docker – containerization

HTML + JavaScript – custom frontend UI

NumPy / Pillow – image preprocessing

🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation

Max-pooling layers for spatial reduction

Fully connected layers for classification

Output layer with 10 classes (digits 0–9)

The trained model is saved as a .pth file and loaded once during API startup.

🌐 Application Interfaces

This application provides three ways to interact with the model:

1️⃣ Custom Web UI (End Users)

URL:

http://localhost:8000/ui


Allows users to:

Upload a handwritten digit image

Get real-time predictions in the browser

2️⃣ REST API (Programmatic Access)
POST /predict

Accepts an image file (multipart/form-data)

Returns the predicted digit

Response example:

{
  "predicted_digit": 5
}

3️⃣ Swagger UI (Developer Testing)

URL:

http://localhost:8000/docs


Auto-generated by FastAPI for API inspection and testing

🐳 Dockerized Deployment
Why Docker?

Docker ensures:

Environment-independent execution

No dependency conflicts

Easy re-run without reinstalling Python or libraries

Reusable and shareable ML applications

🏗️ Build the Docker Image (One-Time Step)

From the project root directory:

docker build -t mnist-fastapi .


⏳ The first build may take time due to PyTorch installation.

▶️ Run the Docker Container
docker run -p 8000:8000 mnist-fastapi


The application will be available at:

Health Check: http://localhost:8000

Custom UI: http://localhost:8000/ui

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs

🔁 Re-running the Application

Docker images are stored locally

You can:

Re-run the container instantly using docker run

Start/stop the app from Docker Desktop GUI

Rebuilding the image is required only when code or dependencies change

🖥️ Running via Docker Desktop (GUI)

Open Docker Desktop

Navigate to Images

Locate mnist-fastapi

Click Run

Map port 8000 → 8000

Access the app through your browser

🧹 Managing Docker Storage

Docker images occupy disk space (ML images are large)

View images:

docker images


Remove image if no longer needed:

docker rmi mnist-fastapi
